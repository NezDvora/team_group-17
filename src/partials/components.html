            Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa,
            sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate. Chocolate
            was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian
            times. Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the
            United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in
            China and Latin America.

            Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of

            solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains
            antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the
